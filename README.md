## Description
This project automates a README.md file through a series of prompts in the command line. This is not a web application and functions without the browser in the command line. 
## Instructions
You will need to install node.js, inquirer package, and the files from GitHub.
## Use
This application should be used as a quick and easy way to write a README.md file without having to worry about formatting of a document or rewriting the README.md file from scratch. This will create a consistent look for your projects and ensure that all necessary information is included.
## Contribute
You can contribute by creating your own fork.
## Tests
This project does not contain any tests. It can work with the jest framework, however this will need to be installed.
